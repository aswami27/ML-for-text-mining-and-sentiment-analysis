# ML-for-text-mining-and-sentiment-analysis
Using "Netflix_Movie_Category_List" dataset, a sentiment analysis was conducted to determine which types of shows receive more positive or negative reviews.
This project explores sentiment analysis on the Netflix Movie Category List dataset to determine which types of shows receive predominantly positive or negative reviews. By analyzing user reviews, we aim to uncover trends in viewer preferences and sentiments across various movie and show categories on Netflix.

Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to identify patterns in audience sentiment for different show categories. This analysis provides insights into how genres and themes influence viewer experiences and opinions, offering potential value to content creators, marketers, and streaming platforms.

Key Features
Dataset: Utilizes the Netflix Movie Category List dataset, which contains movie titles, genres, and associated metadata.

Sentiment Analysis:
Analyzes user reviews to classify sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative.
Explores trends and correlations between show categories and sentiment polarity.

Natural Language Processing (NLP):
Text cleaning and preprocessing to prepare review data for sentiment analysis.
Uses popular libraries such as NLTK, spaCy, or TextBlob for sentiment scoring.

Visualization:
Visual representation of sentiment trends across categories using tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn.
Highlights which genres or categories are most liked or disliked by viewers.

Tools and Technologies
Languages: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, spaCy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
Machine Learning Models: Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, or pre-trained models for sentiment classification (if applicable).

Visualization Tools: Matplotlib, Seaborn

Results
The project outcomes include:

A comprehensive sentiment analysis of Netflix categories, revealing viewer preferences.
Insights into positive and negative sentiments for specific genres.
Data visualizations illustrating sentiment distributions across categories.
